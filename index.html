                            <p>Tatiana Igl√©zia, a BYU intern, recently traveled to Fortaleza to help with screening for malnutrition this past December (2016). There she met our new LCF Coordinator, Gyrleiwe. In the screening in Fortaleza there were 5 children who were found to be in malnutrition status and qualified to receive nutritional supplements through our program.</p>

                                <p>Ecuador was one of the original countries where the Bountiful Children's Foundation established nutrition programs.</p>

                            <p>The greatest consolation for us was to be able to arrive at the stake center with multigrain products to alleviate a little of the need of our brothers and sisters. We had stored the product in previous months. My wife and I had almost 24 cans of multigrain cereals saved. What a joy it was for me and my wife to arrive on Sunday and say to the Stake President that the Bountiful Children's Foundation had provision for the children of the church, more than 500 cans of multigrain cereals to alleviate the hunger of our children. </p>

                                <p>In 2013, the Bountiful Children's Foundation visited the central Philippines to screen children for malnutrition in five areas on Bohol and Cebu islands.</p>

                        <div class="panel-content">
                            <p>The areas were incredibly supportive and were very excited to start nutrition programs for their children. From the screenings on Bohol Island, in the Bogo area, 63 of the 120 children screened were found to be malnourished. In the Calape area on Cebu Island, 108 of the 197 were malnourished. In the Tagbilaron area, 41 of the 80 children screened qualified for the program. Similar rates were found in Mandaue and Lilo-an where 14 of 32, and 48 of 108 children were malnourished, respectively. Since these initial screenings, more areas have been screened throughout the Philippines to now include programs in over 30 areas!</p>
